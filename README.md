## Description
This is a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates a HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

The application will be invoked by using the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```

It is recommended that you start with a directory structure that looks like the following example:

```md
__tests__/			// jest tests
  Employee.test.js
  Engineer.test.js
  Intern.test.js
  Manager.test.js
dist/               // rendered output (HTML) and CSS style sheet
lib/				// classes
src/				// template helper code
index.js			// runs the application
```

The application must include `Employee`, `Manager`, `Engineer`, and `Intern` classes. The tests for these classes (in the `_tests_` directory) must ALL pass.

The first class is an `Employee` parent class with the following properties and methods:

* `name`

* `id`

* `email`

* `getName()`

* `getId()`

* `getEmail()`

* `getRole()`&mdash;returns `'Employee'`

The other three classes will extend `Employee`.

In addition to `Employee`'s properties and methods, `Manager` will also have the following:

* `officeNumber`

* `getRole()`&mdash;overridden to return `'Manager'`

In addition to `Employee`'s properties and methods, `Engineer` will also have the following:

* `github`&mdash;GitHub username

* `getGithub()`

* `getRole()`&mdash;overridden to return `'Engineer'`

In addition to `Employee`'s properties and methods, `Intern` will also have the following:

* `school`

* `getSchool()`

* `getRole()`&mdash;overridden to return `'Intern'`

Finally, although itâ€™s not a requirement, consider adding validation to ensure that user input is in the proper format.
